- Check browser extension is installed
- Refresh page
- Try different wallet (Suiet, Ethos)

### **Transaction fails**

- Increase gas budget
- Show error message to judges (be transparent!)

### **Walrus upload slow**
- Use smaller test file (< 10MB)
- Show progress indicator
- Explain: "Production would use chunked uploads"

## üéØ Judge Q&A Prep

### **Expected Questions**

**Q: How is this different from IPFS?**
- A: Walrus has built-in redundancy, lower costs, and better integration with Sui. IPFS requires separate pinning services.

**Q: What prevents someone from downloading and re-sharing?**
- A: Technical solution: watermarking, fingerprinting. Legal solution: DataAccessCap provides proof of authorized use for courts.

**Q: How do you verify data quality?**
- A: Phase 1: Manual seller reputation. Phase 2: AI-powered quality scoring. Phase 3: Community verification DAO.

**Q: What's your business model?**
- A: 2.5% platform fee on all sales. Transparent, sustainable, fair.

**Q: Why Sui over Ethereum/Solana?**
- A: Fast finality (400ms), low gas costs (<$0.01), Move language safety, native integration with Walrus.

**Q: What about privacy/PII?**
- A: Sellers must confirm data is anonymized. Phase 2: Automatic PII detection. Phase 3: Zero-knowledge proofs for private datasets.

**Q: How do you scale?**
- A: Sui: 100k+ TPS theoretical. Walrus: petabyte-scale storage. No database bottlenecks.

**Q: What's your go-to-market?**
- A: Partner with AI research labs, sponsor Kaggle competitions, integrate with HuggingFace Hub.
