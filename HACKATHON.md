# 🏆 SUILEX - Hackathon Submission

**Tagline**: *"Your data, your Lex. The decentralized AI training data marketplace."*

---

## 🎯 Project Aim

**Suilex** is a fully decentralized marketplace for AI training data built on **Sui blockchain** and **Walrus storage**. We solve the critical problem of **data provenance and ownership** in AI training by:

1. **Enabling creators** to mint their datasets as NFTs with verifiable ownership
2. **Allowing AI companies** to purchase datasets with transparent licensing and legal clarity
3. **Proving ownership and access rights** through blockchain-based DataAccessCap NFTs
4. **Storing data permanently** on decentralized Walrus storage (not centralized servers)

### The Problem We Solve

- 🚫 **AI companies train on data without permission** - creators get nothing
- 🚫 **No way to prove data ownership** - anyone can copy and claim
- 🚫 **Legal gray area** - unclear licensing for AI training
- 🚫 **Centralized platforms** - single points of failure, censorship

### Our Solution

- ✅ **NFT-based ownership** - immutable proof on Sui blockchain
- ✅ **Decentralized storage** - data lives on Walrus, not AWS
- ✅ **Smart contract licensing** - clear terms encoded on-chain
- ✅ **DataAccessCap tokens** - cryptographic proof of purchase
- ✅ **Transparent royalties** - creators earn 97.5% of sales automatically

## 🎨 Core Features

### 1. **User Profiles (On-Chain Identity)**
- Create decentralized profile with unique username
- Upload avatar to Walrus (permanent storage)
- Track stats: datasets created, sales, revenue, ratings
- Social links: Twitter, GitHub, website
- Verification levels: unverified → verified → official

### 2. **Dataset Upload & Minting**
- Upload files up to 10GB to Walrus
- Support for CSV, JSON, TXT, PDF formats

- NFT contains references to Walrus blob IDs (not on-chain data)

### 3. **Marketplace Listings**
- List DataNFTs for sale in SUI tokens
- Dynamic pricing - sellers can update anytime
- Platform fee: 2.5% (transparent, on-chain)
- Search & filter by category, price, verification status

### 4. **Purchase & Access Control**
- Buy datasets with SUI tokens (instant settlement)
- Receive DataAccessCap NFT proving ownership
- Download from Walrus using cryptographic blob ID
- No subscriptions - perpetual access after purchase
- Seller gets paid automatically (97.5% of price)

### 5. **Decentralized Storage**
- All files stored on Walrus (not IPFS or AWS)

## 👥 User Personas & Flows

### **Persona 1: Data Creator (Alice)**
**Profile**: Medical researcher with MRI scan dataset

**Journey**:
1. Connects Sui wallet to Suilex
2. Creates profile: "@alice_research" with bio
3. Navigates to Upload portal
4. Selects 25GB MRI dataset (CSV + images)
5. Uploads to Walrus → receives blob ID
6. Fills metadata: title, description, category (Medical)
7. Sets price: 500 SUI
8. Clicks "Mint NFT" → wallet prompts transaction
9. DataNFT minted on Sui blockchain
10. Optionally lists on marketplace immediately
11. Dashboard shows: "1 dataset, 0 sales, 0 SUI earned"

**Value**: Alice now has verifiable proof of ownership. Anyone who uses her data can be traced back to this NFT.

---

### **Persona 2: AI Company (Bob)**
**Profile**: AI startup training a medical diagnosis model

**Journey**:
1. Connects Sui wallet
2. Browses marketplace, filters: "Medical" category
3. Finds Alice's MRI dataset
4. Views dataset detail page:
   - Title, description, size (25GB)
   - Price: 500 SUI
   - Seller: @alice_research (verified)
   - Preview metadata (JSON)
5. Clicks "Purchase Dataset"
6. Wallet prompts: 500 SUI payment
7. Smart contract executes:
   - Takes 500 SUI from Bob
   - Pays 487.5 SUI to Alice (97.5%)
   - Keeps 12.5 SUI as platform fee (2.5%)
   - Mints DataAccessCap NFT to Bob
8. Bob can now download dataset from Walrus
9. Bob's DataAccessCap proves legal ownership
10. Alice's dashboard updates: "1 sale, 487.5 SUI earned"

**Value**: Bob has on-chain proof that he legally purchased training data. If his AI model succeeds, he can prove compliance.

---

### **Persona 3: Platform (Decentralized Revenue)**
**Journey**:
1. Smart contracts deployed to Sui mainnet
2. ProfileRegistry shared object created
3. Marketplace shared object created
4. Platform fee set to 250 basis points (2.5%)
5. Every purchase → 2.5% collected in Marketplace balance
6. Admin can withdraw accumulated fees
7. Transparent on-chain: anyone can verify fee structure

**Value**: Sustainable business model without rent-seeking. All fees transparent.
